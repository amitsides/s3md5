## Issues

To be noted, Helm 3 doesn't help us creating `namespace`, we have to create it ourselves.  
Please click the link below to follow the issue.
   
[GitHub Issue - Helm 3 doesn't create namespace](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5753)

It doesn't really make sense to create `namespace` by the user, also provide `--namespace` argument.  
However, it also makes sense because the user should control all of it by themselves that `namespace` is not Helm's responsibility which I believe it's right.
